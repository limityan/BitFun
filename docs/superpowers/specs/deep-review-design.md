# Deep Review Strategy Engine & Architecture Reviewer Design

## Overview

This document proposes a set of improvements to BitFun's deep review system to address timeout, rate-limit, and coverage issues when reviewing large code changes with slow or rate-limited models.

The proposal has three parts:
1. **Strategy Engine** (方案2): Programmatic strategy selection, predictive timeouts, dynamic concurrency control, and partial result capture.
2. **Architecture Reviewer**: A new core reviewer role focused on structural/architectural concerns, always-on across all strategy levels.
3. **Frontend Reviewer**: A new core reviewer role focused on frontend-specific concerns (React, i18n, accessibility, state management).

## Implementation Status

### Completed

- Added `ReviewArchitecture` as an always-on core reviewer role.
- Added `ReviewFrontend` as a frontend-focused reviewer role in the review team model.
- Added dedicated prompts for Architecture and Frontend reviewers.
- Updated DeepReview orchestration prompt to dispatch Architecture and Frontend reviewers and to provide role-specific strategy amplification.
- Updated existing reviewer prompts to reduce overlap:
  - Business Logic no longer owns UI state or layer-boundary analysis.
  - Performance no longer owns React render optimization.
  - Security focuses on exploitable trust-boundary risks, while structural boundaries move to Architecture.
- Updated Judge prompt with cross-reviewer overlap handling for Architecture/Business Logic, Architecture/Security, Frontend/Performance, and Frontend/Business Logic overlaps.
- Updated review team service, tests, and UI metadata for the new roles.
- Updated Settings > Review i18n so Architecture and Frontend reviewer names render in the active language.
- Updated the Agents page Code Review Team card to avoid clipped reviewer tags and present a compact role-summary layout.
- Added the initial predictive-timeout loop: the launch manifest records target file stats, derives effective reviewer/judge timeouts from strategy and target size, and the core Task tool honors that manifest policy when launching DeepReview subagents.

### Remaining / Future Work

- Convert Frontend Reviewer from always-present metadata to truly conditional dispatch based on changed frontend files.
- Make hidden review-agent IDs derive from review team role definitions instead of manual lists.
- Move core reviewer definitions and strategy directives toward a backend-provided manifest to reduce duplicated frontend/backend role configuration.
- Extend predictive timeout with diff line-count stats, then add partial result capture, risk classification, dynamic concurrency control, and retry budget from the Strategy Engine plan.
- Add automated coverage tests for new role i18n and card layout constraints.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture

BitFun's deep review is a **prompt-driven 5-phase orchestrator** (`DeepReview` agent) coordinating 4 always-on specialist reviewers, an optional frontend-focused reviewer, and 1 sequential judge:

```
Phase 1: Scope identification
Phase 2: Parallel dispatch (BusinessLogic, Performance, Security, Architecture + Frontend when applicable + extras)
Phase 3: Quality gate (ReviewJudge validates/merges findings)
Phase 4: Report synthesis (submit_code_review)
Phase 5: Optional remediation (Edit/Write/Bash)
```

Key components:
- **Policy layer**: `deep_review_policy.rs` — execution policy, budget tracker, file splitting
- **Task tool enforcement**: `task_tool.rs` — readonly/review/budget/timeout enforcement
- **Coordinator**: `coordinator.rs` — subagent execution with dynamic timeout adjustment
- **Frontend**: `reviewTeamService.ts` + `DeepReviewService.ts` — manifest building, session management

### Current Strengths

1. Defense-in-depth policy enforcement (programmatic, not just prompt)
2. Clean separation: orchestrator (write) vs reviewers (read-only)
3. Configurable strategy levels with per-member overrides
4. File splitting for large changes (threshold: 20 files, max 3 instances/role)
5. Continuation/recovery for interrupted reviews
6. Budget tracking with TTL-based pruning

### Current Weaknesses

| Dimension | Problem | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Orchestration determinism** | 5-phase workflow exists only in prompt text; LLM may skip phases or serialize reviewers | Weak models increase total runtime 3x |
| **Timeout strategy** | Static timeout (600s) for all reviewers regardless of change size | Large changes always timeout; small changes waste time |
| **Dynamic concurrency** | Fixed 3 roles + file splitting; no rate limit awareness | 6-9 parallel LLM calls may trigger provider rate limits |
| **Error fallback** | No retry logic; `provider_quota` blocks entirely; no partial result preservation | Timed-out reviewer loses all work |
| **Context management** | No diff summarization; each reviewer reads files independently; prompt block is 100+ lines | Wastes context window and tokens |
| **Strategy selection** | Manual configuration (quick/normal/deep) | Users may misconfigure for change size |

### Scenario Breakdown

| Scenario | Files | Lines | Current Behavior | Problem |
|----------|-------|-------|------------------|---------|
| A: Small change | < 5 | < 200 | 3 reviewers parallel, ~2-3 min | Over-provisioned for small changes |
| B: Medium change | 5-20 | 200-1000 | 3 reviewers parallel, ~5-8 min | Logic reviewer may timeout |
| C: Large change | 20-50 | 1000+ | File split: 6-9 instances + judge | Rate limits, judge timeout, duplicate IO |
| D: Any + slow model | Any | Any | Same as above | Frequent timeout; no adaptive behavior |
| E: Any + rate limit | Any | Any | All parallel calls hit limit | `provider_quota` blocks entire review |

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Architecture | Parallelism | Large Change | Adaptive | Budget |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **BitFun (current)** | 3 specialists + judge | True parallel | File split (threshold 20) | Manual strategy | Static per-turn |
| GitHub Copilot | Single model, single pass | N/A | Skip if > ~3000 lines | None | Service-managed |
| CodeRabbit | Single model, multi-pass | Sequential passes | Chunk + summary-first | Heuristic (PR size) | Implicit (chunking) |
| Amazon CodeGuru | Detector ensemble | Parallel detectors | File-level + incremental | Static (language) | Per-detector |
| Google AutoCommenter | Single model, chunked | Sequential chunks | Chunk by file | Confidence threshold | Per-chunk |

**Key insights from research:**
- No major AI tool has dedicated architecture reviewer as separate agent
- Research (Hong et al., 2024) suggests 3-5 agents with non-overlapping scopes is optimal
- Risk-based automatic strategy selection can reduce review time ~30% (Munaiah et al., 2017)
- Budget-aware dynamic reallocation improves efficiency (Wang et al., 2024)

## Part 1: Strategy Engine (方案2)

### 1.1 Change Risk Auto-Classification

**Goal**: Automatically recommend strategy level based on change characteristics.

**Implementation**:

Add a new method to `DeepReviewExecutionPolicy`:

```rust
/// Risk factors used for automatic strategy selection
pub struct ChangeRiskFactors {
    pub file_count: usize,
    pub total_lines_changed: usize,
    pub files_in_security_paths: usize,  // e.g. auth/, crypto/, api/
    pub max_cyclomatic_complexity_delta: usize,
    pub cross_crate_changes: usize,  // files in different crates
}

impl DeepReviewExecutionPolicy {
    /// Auto-select strategy level based on change risk.
    /// Returns recommended level and a human-readable rationale.
    pub fn auto_select_strategy(&self, risk: &ChangeRiskFactors) -> (DeepReviewStrategyLevel, String) {
        let score = risk.file_count
            + risk.total_lines_changed / 100
            + risk.files_in_security_paths * 3
            + risk.cross_crate_changes * 2;

        match score {
            0..=5 => (DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Quick,
                      format!("Small change ({} files, {} lines). Quick scan sufficient.",
                              risk.file_count, risk.total_lines_changed)),
            6..=20 => (DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Normal,
                       format!("Medium change ({} files, {} lines). Standard review recommended.",
                               risk.file_count, risk.total_lines_changed)),
            _ => (DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Deep,
                  format!("Large/high-risk change ({} files, {} lines, {} security files). Deep review recommended.",
                          risk.file_count, risk.total_lines_changed, risk.files_in_security_paths)),
        }
    }
}
```

**Risk factor computation**:
- `file_count` and `total_lines_changed`: from `GetFileDiff` or `Git diff --stat`
- `files_in_security_paths`: configurable list of path patterns (e.g. `**/auth/**`, `**/crypto/**`)
- `max_cyclomatic_complexity_delta`: computed by a lightweight AST pass or heuristic
- `cross_crate_changes`: count files across different `Cargo.toml` workspaces

**Frontend integration**:
- `reviewTeamService.ts` computes risk factors before building the manifest
- UI shows recommended strategy with rationale; user can override
- Override is persisted per-project

### 1.2 Predictive Timeout

**Goal**: Set per-reviewer timeout based on change size and strategy, not static defaults.

**Current state**:
```rust
const DEFAULT_REVIEWER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: u64 = 600;  // 10 minutes
const DEFAULT_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: u64 = 600;     // 10 minutes
```

**Proposed state**:
```rust
/// Base timeout per strategy (seconds)
const BASE_TIMEOUT_QUICK: u64 = 180;
const BASE_TIMEOUT_NORMAL: u64 = 300;
const BASE_TIMEOUT_DEEP: u64 = 600;

/// Per-file overhead (seconds)
const TIMEOUT_PER_FILE: u64 = 15;
const TIMEOUT_PER_100_LINES: u64 = 30;

impl DeepReviewExecutionPolicy {
    pub fn predictive_timeout(
        &self,
        role: DeepReviewSubagentRole,
        strategy: DeepReviewStrategyLevel,
        file_count: usize,
        line_count: usize,
    ) -> u64 {
        let base = match strategy {
            DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Quick => BASE_TIMEOUT_QUICK,
            DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Normal => BASE_TIMEOUT_NORMAL,
            DeepReviewStrategyLevel::Deep => BASE_TIMEOUT_DEEP,
        };

        let file_overhead = file_count as u64 * TIMEOUT_PER_FILE;
        let line_overhead = (line_count as u64 / 100) * TIMEOUT_PER_100_LINES;

        let raw = base + file_overhead + line_overhead;

        // Judge needs more time when there are more reviewer reports
        let judge_multiplier = match role {
            DeepReviewSubagentRole::Judge => {
                let reviewer_count = CORE_REVIEWER_AGENT_TYPES.len() + self.extra_subagent_ids.len();
                1 + (reviewer_count as u64 - 1) / 3  // +1 for every 3 reviewers
            }
            DeepReviewSubagentRole::Reviewer => 1,
        };

        let predicted = raw * judge_multiplier;
        predicted.min(MAX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS)
    }
}
```

**Example predictions**:

| Change | Strategy | Files | Lines | Reviewer Timeout | Judge Timeout |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| 3 files, 150 lines | Quick | 3 | 150 | 180 + 45 + 30 = 255s | 255s |
| 15 files, 800 lines | Normal | 15 | 800 | 300 + 225 + 240 = 765s → 600s (capped) | 600s |
| 30 files, 2000 lines | Deep | 30 | 2000 | 600 + 450 + 600 = 1650s → 1200s (capped) | 1200s × 1 = 1200s |
| 30 files, 2000 lines + 2 extras | Deep | 30 | 2000 | 1650s → 1200s | 1650s × 2 = 2400s → 1800s (capped) |

**Integration**:
- Frontend computes `file_count` and `line_count` from diff before building manifest
- Passes them in the prompt block or as config fields
- `effective_timeout_seconds` is updated to call `predictive_timeout` when risk factors are available

### 1.3 Dynamic Concurrency Control

**Goal**: Prevent rate limit violations by controlling how many reviewers launch in parallel.

**Current state**: All reviewers launch in a single message (true parallelism). With 3 core roles + file splitting (3 instances each) + extras, this can be 9+ parallel LLM calls.

**Proposed state**:

Add `DeepReviewConcurrencyPolicy`:

```rust
pub struct DeepReviewConcurrencyPolicy {
    /// Maximum parallel reviewer instances at once
    pub max_parallel_instances: usize,
    /// Whether to stagger launches (wait N seconds between batches)
    pub stagger_seconds: u64,
    /// Whether to batch extras separately from core reviewers
    pub batch_extras_separately: bool,
}

impl Default for DeepReviewConcurrencyPolicy {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_parallel_instances: 4,
            stagger_seconds: 0,
            batch_extras_separately: true,
        }
    }
}
```

**Launch strategy**:

```
Batch 1 (immediate): Core 3 reviewers (BL, Perf, Sec)
  - If file splitting: up to 3 instances per role, but total <= max_parallel_instances
  - Example: max_parallel_instances=4, 3 core roles → 1 instance each (no splitting)
  - Example: max_parallel_instances=6, 3 core roles → 2 instances each

Wait for Batch 1 to complete or timeout

Batch 2 (if needed): Extra reviewers
  - Only if extras are configured and Batch 1 completed
  - Respects max_parallel_instances
```

**Rate limit awareness**:

The frontend can query the current model's rate limit status (from a lightweight endpoint or cached state) and adjust `max_parallel_instances`:

```typescript
function computeConcurrencyPolicy(
  modelSlot: string,
  rateLimitStatus: RateLimitStatus | null,
): DeepReviewConcurrencyPolicy {
  const baseMax = 4;
  if (!rateLimitStatus || rateLimitStatus.remaining > baseMax * 2) {
    return { max_parallel_instances: baseMax, stagger_seconds: 0, batch_extras_separately: true };
  }
  if (rateLimitStatus.remaining > baseMax) {
    return { max_parallel_instances: baseMax, stagger_seconds: 5, batch_extras_separately: true };
  }
  // Rate limit is tight: reduce parallelism and add stagger
  return {
    max_parallel_instances: Math.max(2, rateLimitStatus.remaining),
    stagger_seconds: 10,
    batch_extras_separately: true,
  };
}
```

**Integration with file splitting**:

When `max_parallel_instances` is tight, file splitting should be reduced or disabled:

```rust
pub fn effective_max_same_role_instances(
    &self,
    file_count: usize,
    concurrency_policy: &DeepReviewConcurrencyPolicy,
) -> usize {
    let role_count = CORE_REVIEWER_AGENT_TYPES.len() + self.extra_subagent_ids.len();
    let max_per_role = concurrency_policy.max_parallel_instances / role_count;
    max_per_role.max(1).min(self.max_same_role_instances)
}
```

### 1.4 Partial Result Capture

**Goal**: When a reviewer times out, preserve its last output instead of losing all work.

**Current state**: Coordinator uses `tokio::time::timeout` which returns `Err(Timeout)` with no partial data.

**Proposed state**:

Modify the coordinator's `execute_subagent` to capture the last model response before timeout:

```rust
// In coordinator.rs, around the timeout wrapping logic:
let result = if let Some(secs) = timeout_seconds.filter(|&s| s > 0) {
    let timeout_future = tokio::time::timeout(
        Duration::from_secs(secs),
        self.run_subagent_loop(...)
    );
    match timeout_future.await {
        Ok(result) => result,
        Err(_) => {
            // Timeout fired — try to capture partial results
            let partial = self.try_capture_partial_results(&session_id).await;
            match partial {
                Some(partial_result) => {
                    // Return partial result with a timeout marker
                    Ok(SubagentResult {
                        response: format!("{}", partial_result),
                        status: SubagentStatus::PartialTimeout,
                        ..partial_result
                    })
                }
                None => Err(BitFunError::Timeout(timeout_error_message)),
            }
        }
    }
} else {
    self.run_subagent_loop(...).await
};
```

**Partial result capture mechanism**:

The subagent's dialog turns are stored in the session store. `try_capture_partial_results` would:
1. Read the subagent session's dialog turns
2. Find the last assistant message (model output)
3. Extract any findings already written in the expected format
4. Return them as a partial result

**Frontend handling**:

`deepReviewContinuation.ts` already detects `timed_out` status. It should be updated to handle `PartialTimeout`:

```typescript
// In collectReviewerProgress:
if (toolResult.status === 'partial_timeout' ||
    (toolResult.error && /partial timeout/i.test(toolResult.error))) {
  status = 'partial_timeout';
}

// In buildDeepReviewContinuationPrompt:
// Include partial findings with reduced confidence
```

**Judge handling**:

The judge prompt already instructs it to handle partial results. The `ReviewJudge` should treat `partial_timeout` findings with lower confidence than `completed` findings.

### 1.5 Retry Budget

**Goal**: Allow each reviewer role one retry with reduced scope when it times out or fails.

**Current state**: `DeepReviewTurnBudget` tracks:
- `reviewer_calls`: max calls per turn
- `judge_calls`: max 1 per turn

**Proposed state**:

Add retry tracking:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct DeepReviewTurnBudget {
    reviewer_calls: usize,
    judge_calls: usize,
    retries_used: HashMap<String, usize>,  // role -> retry count
    max_retries_per_role: usize,            // default: 1
    updated_at: Instant,
}
```

**Retry logic**:

When a reviewer times out or fails:
1. Orchestrator checks `retries_used[role] < max_retries_per_role`
2. If yes, re-dispatch with:
   - Same target but reduced scope (only files not yet reviewed)
   - Reduced timeout (original timeout / 2)
   - Strategy downgraded one level (deep → normal, normal → quick)
3. Increment `retries_used[role]`

**Integration with continuation**:

The continuation system already handles re-running failed reviewers. The retry budget adds a cap to prevent infinite loops.

## Part 2: Architecture Reviewer

### 2.1 Rationale

**Gap analysis**: The current 3 reviewers cover correctness, performance, and security. However, several categories of issues have no dedicated reviewer:

1. **Module coupling / dependency direction violations** — e.g. core crate importing from desktop app
2. **Layer violations** — e.g. service layer bypassing API abstraction
3. **API contract design** — e.g. Tauri commands not following `snake_case` + structured request pattern
4. **Abstraction integrity** — e.g. platform-specific details escaping through shared interfaces
5. **Design pattern consistency** — e.g. new features not following established patterns
6. **Structural scalability** — e.g. changes requiring cross-cutting modifications in 5+ crates

**Research findings**:
- No major AI code review tool has a dedicated architecture reviewer as a separate parallel agent
- Architecture concerns are typically folded into "maintainability" or "code quality" within a single reviewer
- Research (Hong et al., 2024) suggests 3-5 agents with non-overlapping scopes is optimal; 5+1 is still within the efficient range
- Google's code review culture treats "Design" as the most important dimension, but handled by the same reviewer

**Overlap risk with Business Logic reviewer**:
- BL reviewer: "Does this call chain produce correct results?"
- Architecture reviewer: "Should this call chain exist at all? Does it respect layer boundaries?"
- The deep strategy already asks BL to "map full call chains" — this borders on architectural analysis but from a correctness angle

### 2.2 Scope Definition

**Architecture Reviewer** (`ReviewArchitecture`):

**Covers**:
- Module boundary violations (imports that violate layer dependencies)
- API contract design (Tauri commands, tool schemas, transport messages)
- Abstraction integrity (platform-agnostic violations, bypassed interfaces)
- Structural consistency (patterns, registration conventions)
- Dependency direction (circular dependencies, wrong-direction imports)
- Cross-cutting concern impact (changes touching too many layers)

**Explicitly excludes** (to avoid overlap):
- Business rule correctness → Business Logic reviewer
- Algorithm performance → Performance reviewer
- Security vulnerabilities → Security reviewer
- Code style/formatting → not a review dimension

### 2.3 Activation Strategy: Always-On Across All Strategy Levels

**Revised recommendation: Architecture Reviewer should be always-on, not deep-only.**

Previous analysis recommended deep-only activation to minimize cost. However, further investigation reveals:

**Why architecture review matters at every strategy level**:

1. **Quick reviews still need architecture checks**: A 3-file change that adds `import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api'` directly in a React component violates the adapter pattern regardless of strategy level. Quick reviews that skip architecture miss exactly the kind of issue that is cheap to find but expensive to fix later.

2. **Architecture violations are cheap to detect**: Unlike business logic review (which requires reading surrounding context), architecture review primarily uses `LS`, `Glob`, and `Grep` for import analysis. The token cost is significantly lower than other reviewers — estimated at 0.6-0.8x of a typical reviewer's cost.

3. **Layer violations compound**: An architecture violation that slips through a quick review will be harder to catch later. The cost of missing it early is disproportionately high.

4. **BitFun's explicit architectural rules**: The project has documented rules ("keep product logic platform-agnostic", "do not call Tauri APIs directly from UI components") that should be checked on every review, not just deep ones.

**Cost mitigation for always-on**:

| Strategy | Architecture Reviewer Behavior | Estimated Token Cost |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Quick | Only check imports directly changed by the diff | ~0.3x |
| Normal | Check diff imports + one level of dependency direction | ~0.6x |
| Deep | Map full dependency graph for changed modules | ~0.8x |

At quick strategy, the architecture reviewer's cost is minimal because it only inspects import statements in changed files — no context reading, no call chain tracing.

**Updated team composition**:

| Strategy | Reviewers | Total Parallel Calls (no split) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Quick | BL, Perf, Sec, **Arch** | 4 |
| Normal | BL, Perf, Sec, **Arch** | 4 |
| Deep | BL, Perf, Sec, **Arch**, **Frontend** (if frontend files present) | 4-5 |

### 2.4 Implementation

**New files**:
- `src/crates/core/src/agentic/agents/prompts/review_architecture_agent.md`

**Modified files**:

1. **`deep_review_policy.rs`**:
   - Add `REVIEWER_ARCHITECTURE_AGENT_TYPE: &str = "ReviewArchitecture"`
   - Update `CORE_REVIEWER_AGENT_TYPES` from `[&str; 3]` to `[&str; 4]`
   - Budget test updates

2. **`review_specialist_agents.rs`**:
   - Add `ArchitectureReviewerAgent` using `define_readonly_subagent!`

3. **`registry.rs`**:
   - Add `ReviewArchitecture` to `default_model_id_for_builtin_agent` → `"fast"`
   - Add to `is_review_agent_entry` check

4. **`deep_review_agent.md` (orchestrator prompt)**:
   - Update "Team Shape" to include Architecture Reviewer as 4th mandatory role
   - Add role-specific strategy amplification for Architecture

5. **`reviewTeamService.ts` (frontend)**:
   - Add `'architecture'` to `ReviewTeamCoreRoleKey`
   - Add `'ReviewArchitecture'` to `ReviewRoleDirectiveKey`
   - Add architecture entry to `DEFAULT_REVIEW_TEAM_CORE_ROLES`
   - Add strategy directives for architecture in all three profiles
   - Update `buildReviewTeamPromptBlock`

6. **Localization**:
   - Add architecture reviewer strings in en-US and zh-CN

7. **Tests**:
   - `deep_review_policy.rs` tests: Update budget calculation assertions
   - `reviewTeamService.test.ts`: Update manifest building tests

### 2.5 Cost Impact (Always-On)

| Metric | Current (3+1) | With Architecture (4+1, always-on) | Delta |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Parallel calls (no split) | 3 | 4 | +33% |
| Parallel calls (3 instances/role) | 9 | 12 | +33% |
| Token cost (quick) | 0.4-0.6x | 0.5-0.8x | +~0.2x |
| Token cost (normal) | 1x | 1.2-1.3x | +~0.25x |
| Token cost (deep) | 1.8-2.5x | 2.2-3.0x | +~0.4x |

**Mitigation**: Architecture reviewer uses `fast` model slot at all strategy levels, and primarily uses `LS`/`Glob`/`Grep` (cheaper than `Read`), so actual cost increase is lower than the raw +33% parallel call increase.

## Part 3: Frontend Reviewer

### 3.1 Rationale

**Why a dedicated Frontend Reviewer is needed**:

The BitFun frontend is a substantial portion of the codebase (~250+ TSX components, ~300+ TS files, 96 locale files) with domain-specific concerns that no current reviewer can effectively evaluate:

| Concern | Current Coverage | Gap |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| **i18n key synchronization** | None | 96 locale files across 3 languages; missing keys in one locale is a common failure |
| **React performance patterns** | Performance reviewer mentions "expensive renders" generically | Cannot identify React-specific anti-patterns: missing memo/useCallback/useMemo, inline functions in JSX, missing virtualization |
| **Accessibility** | None | Only ~40 aria/role attributes across 250+ components — severely under-covered |
| **Zustand state management** | BL reviewer might catch circular deps as "logic issue" | Cannot recognize Zustand-specific patterns: selector granularity, store dependencies, stale closures |
| **Platform boundary (frontend)** | None | ~6 files import `@tauri-apps/api` directly instead of through adapter layer |
| **Event bus contract alignment** | None | Backend events and frontend listeners must stay in sync; contract drift is invisible |
| **CSS/theme consistency** | None | ThemeService, Monaco theme sync, component library usage patterns |

**Concrete examples that fall through the cracks**:

1. A developer adds `t('scenes.agents.newFeature')` but only adds the key to `en-US/scenes/agents.json`, forgetting `zh-CN` and `zh-TW`. No current reviewer catches this.

2. A developer creates a large list component without virtualization, or defines inline object/function references in JSX causing re-renders. The Performance Reviewer mentions "unnecessary re-renders" but lacks React-specific knowledge.

3. A new modal dialog is added without `aria-labelledby`, focus trap, or keyboard navigation. No reviewer has accessibility in its mission.

4. A Rust backend Tauri command changes its request/response types, but the corresponding TypeScript API client is not updated. No reviewer systematically checks frontend-backend API contract alignment.

### 3.2 Scope Definition

**Frontend Reviewer** (`ReviewFrontend`):

**Covers**:
- i18n completeness and key synchronization across locales
- React performance patterns (memoization, virtualization, effect dependencies)
- Accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- State management patterns (Zustand selector granularity, store dependencies)
- Frontend-backend API contract alignment (Tauri command types, event payloads)
- Platform boundary compliance (no direct `@tauri-apps/api` outside adapter layer)
- CSS/theme consistency (ThemeService usage, component library patterns)

**Explicitly excludes** (to avoid overlap):
- Business rule correctness → Business Logic reviewer
- Algorithm performance (non-React) → Performance reviewer
- Security vulnerabilities → Security reviewer
- Architecture (backend layer violations) → Architecture reviewer

### 3.3 Activation Strategy: Conditional on Frontend File Presence

The Frontend Reviewer should only activate when the change includes frontend files. This avoids wasting resources on pure-backend changes.

**Detection logic** (in the orchestrator or frontend manifest builder):

```typescript
function hasFrontendFiles(changedFiles: string[]): boolean {
  return changedFiles.some(f =>
    f.startsWith('src/web-ui/') ||
    f.startsWith('src/mobile-web/') ||
    f.endsWith('.tsx') ||
    f.endsWith('.scss') ||
    f.endsWith('.css') ||
    f.includes('/locales/')
  );
}
```

**Updated team composition**:

| Strategy | Backend-only change | Change with frontend files |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Quick | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch, **Frontend** |
| Normal | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch, **Frontend** |
| Deep | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch | BL, Perf, Sec, Arch, **Frontend** |

### 3.4 Implementation

**New files**:
- `src/crates/core/src/agentic/agents/prompts/review_frontend_agent.md`

**Modified files**:

1. **`deep_review_policy.rs`**:
   - Add `REVIEWER_FRONTEND_AGENT_TYPE: &str = "ReviewFrontend"`
   - Add `FRONTEND_REVIEWER_AGENT_TYPE` to a new `CONDITIONAL_REVIEWER_AGENT_TYPES` array
   - Update budget calculation to account for conditional reviewers

2. **`review_specialist_agents.rs`**:
   - Add `FrontendReviewerAgent` using `define_readonly_subagent!`

3. **`registry.rs`**:
   - Add `ReviewFrontend` to `default_model_id_for_builtin_agent` → `"fast"`
   - Add to `is_review_agent_entry` check

4. **`deep_review_agent.md` (orchestrator prompt)**:
   - Add Frontend Reviewer as conditional role: "If the change includes frontend files (src/web-ui/, .tsx, .scss, locales/), also launch ReviewFrontend in the same parallel batch."

5. **`reviewTeamService.ts` (frontend)**:
   - Add `'frontend'` to `ReviewTeamCoreRoleKey`
   - Add `'ReviewFrontend'` to `ReviewRoleDirectiveKey`
   - Add frontend entry to `DEFAULT_REVIEW_TEAM_CORE_ROLES` with `conditional: true` flag
   - Add strategy directives for frontend in all three profiles
   - Detect frontend files in the change and conditionally include Frontend Reviewer in manifest

6. **Localization**:
   - Add frontend reviewer strings in en-US and zh-CN

7. **Tests**:
   - `deep_review_policy.rs` tests: Update budget calculation for conditional reviewers
   - `reviewTeamService.test.ts`: Test conditional inclusion logic

### 3.5 Cost Impact (Conditional)

| Metric | Backend-only change | Change with frontend files |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Parallel calls (no split) | 4 (same as architecture-only) | 5 |
| Token cost (quick) | 0.5-0.8x | 0.6-1.0x |
| Token cost (normal) | 1.2-1.3x | 1.4-1.6x |
| Token cost (deep) | 2.2-3.0x | 2.6-3.5x |

**Mitigation**: Frontend Reviewer uses `fast` model slot at all strategy levels. At quick strategy, it primarily checks i18n keys and import patterns (cheap). At deep strategy, it does thorough React analysis (more expensive but still bounded).

## Part 4: Changes to Existing Reviewer Prompts

Adding Architecture and Frontend reviewers requires adjustments to existing reviewer prompts to eliminate overlap and clarify boundaries.

### 4.1 Business Logic Reviewer Changes

**Current mission items to modify**:

| Current Item | Issue | Change |
|---|---|---|
| "partial updates that can leave data or UI in an inconsistent state" | "UI" overlaps with Frontend Reviewer's state management scope | Change to "partial updates that can leave data in an inconsistent state" — remove "or UI" since Frontend Reviewer covers React state consistency |
| Deep strategy: "map the full call chain for each changed function" | Overlaps with Architecture Reviewer's dependency analysis | Change to "map the full call chain for each changed function to verify business rules and state transitions" — explicitly scope to correctness, not structural analysis |

**New exclusion note** (add to Review Standards section):

```markdown
## What you do NOT review

- Whether a call chain should exist or respects layer boundaries (Architecture Reviewer)
- React component state, i18n, or accessibility issues (Frontend Reviewer)
- Performance of specific algorithms (Performance Reviewer)
- Security vulnerabilities (Security Reviewer)
```

### 4.2 Performance Reviewer Changes

**Current mission items to modify**:

| Current Item | Issue | Change |
|---|---|---|
| "expensive renders or recomputations" | Overlaps with Frontend Reviewer's React performance scope | Change to "expensive computations on hot paths" — remove "renders" since Frontend Reviewer covers React rendering performance |
| "unnecessary re-renders" (in quick strategy efficiency rules) | Overlaps with Frontend Reviewer | Remove from Performance Reviewer; Frontend Reviewer handles React-specific render optimization |
| "oversized diffs / payloads / serialization" | Partially overlaps with Architecture Reviewer's API contract scope | Keep but clarify: "oversized payloads or serialization on data paths" — focus on runtime cost, not contract design |

**New exclusion note**:

```markdown
## What you do NOT review

- React rendering performance or component memoization (Frontend Reviewer)
- Whether a data path respects layer boundaries (Architecture Reviewer)
- Security vulnerabilities (Security Reviewer)
- Business rule correctness (Business Logic Reviewer)
```

### 4.3 Security Reviewer Changes

**Current mission items to modify**:

| Current Item | Issue | Change |
|---|---|---|
| "trust-boundary violations" | Overlaps with Architecture Reviewer's layer boundary checks | Clarify scope: "trust-boundary violations that create exploitable security risks" — Architecture Reviewer checks structural boundaries; Security Reviewer checks exploitable ones |
| "insecure defaults" | Partially overlaps with Architecture Reviewer's API contract checks | Keep but clarify: "insecure defaults in authentication, authorization, or data handling" — scope to security-relevant defaults |

**New exclusion note**:

```markdown
## What you do NOT review

- Structural layer violations without exploitable security impact (Architecture Reviewer)
- Frontend-specific security concerns like XSS in React components (Frontend Reviewer)
- Business rule correctness (Business Logic Reviewer)
- Algorithm performance (Performance Reviewer)
```

### 4.4 Judge Changes

The Judge prompt needs to be updated to handle 4-5 reviewer reports instead of 3:

**Current behavior**: Judge validates findings from 3 core reviewers.

**Required changes**:

1. **Update efficiency rules**: The judge already has strategy-aware efficiency rules. Update the deep strategy directive to explicitly mention cross-validation between Architecture and Business Logic findings (since these roles have the most potential overlap).

2. **Add overlap detection guidance**:

```markdown
## Overlap detection

When multiple reviewers report findings about the same code location:
- If Architecture Reviewer flags a layer violation and Security Reviewer flags a trust-boundary issue at the same location, keep both but note the architectural root cause may address both.
- If Business Logic Reviewer flags a call chain issue and Architecture Reviewer flags the same chain as a dependency violation, the Architecture finding is the root cause; downgrade the BL finding to a symptom.
- If Frontend Reviewer flags a React performance issue and Performance Reviewer flags a general performance issue at the same component, merge into a single finding with both perspectives.
```

3. **Update partial timeout handling**: With more reviewers, the probability of partial timeouts increases. The judge should be instructed to handle partial results from 4-5 reviewers gracefully.

### 4.5 Orchestrator Prompt Changes

**Current "Team Shape" section**:

```
Team shape (mandatory):
- Business Logic Reviewer (ReviewBusinessLogic)
- Performance Reviewer (ReviewPerformance)
- Security Reviewer (ReviewSecurity)
- Review Quality Inspector (ReviewJudge)
```

**Updated "Team Shape" section**:

```
Team shape (mandatory):
- Business Logic Reviewer (ReviewBusinessLogic)
- Performance Reviewer (ReviewPerformance)
- Security Reviewer (ReviewSecurity)
- Architecture Reviewer (ReviewArchitecture)
- [Conditional] Frontend Reviewer (ReviewFrontend) — include only when the change contains frontend files (src/web-ui/, .tsx, .scss, locales/)
- Review Quality Inspector (ReviewJudge)
```

**Updated role-specific strategy amplification** — add entries for Architecture and Frontend:

```
- **ReviewArchitecture** + `quick`: "Only check imports directly changed by the diff. Flag violations of documented layer boundaries."
- **ReviewArchitecture** + `normal`: "Check the diff's imports plus one level of dependency direction. Verify API contract consistency."
- **ReviewArchitecture** + `deep`: "Map the full dependency graph for changed modules. Check for structural anti-patterns, circular dependencies, and cross-cutting concerns."
- **ReviewFrontend** + `quick`: "Only check i18n key completeness and direct platform boundary violations in changed frontend files."
- **ReviewFrontend** + `normal`: "Check i18n, React performance patterns, and accessibility in changed components. Verify frontend-backend API contract alignment."
- **ReviewFrontend** + `deep`: "Thorough React analysis: effect dependencies, memoization, virtualization. Full accessibility audit. State management pattern review. Cross-layer contract verification."
```

### 4.6 Frontend Strategy Directives

Add to `REVIEW_STRATEGY_PROFILES` in `reviewTeamService.ts`:

```typescript
// Architecture Reviewer directives
ReviewArchitecture: {
  quick: 'Only check imports directly changed by the diff. Flag violations of documented layer boundaries.',
  normal: "Check the diff's imports plus one level of dependency direction. Verify API contract consistency.",
  deep: 'Map the full dependency graph for changed modules. Check for structural anti-patterns, circular dependencies, and cross-cutting concerns.',
}

// Frontend Reviewer directives
ReviewFrontend: {
  quick: 'Only check i18n key completeness and direct platform boundary violations in changed frontend files.',
  normal: 'Check i18n, React performance patterns, and accessibility in changed components. Verify frontend-backend API contract alignment.',
  deep: 'Thorough React analysis: effect dependencies, memoization, virtualization. Full accessibility audit. State management pattern review. Cross-layer contract verification.',
}
```

### 4.7 Summary of All Prompt Changes

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `review_business_logic_agent.md` | Modify | Remove "or UI" from partial updates; scope deep strategy to correctness; add exclusion note |
| `review_performance_agent.md` | Modify | Remove "renders" from mission; remove "unnecessary re-renders" from efficiency rules; add exclusion note |
| `review_security_agent.md` | Modify | Clarify "trust-boundary violations" scope to exploitable risks; add exclusion note |
| `review_quality_gate_agent.md` | Modify | Add overlap detection guidance for Architecture/BL and Frontend/Perf; update partial timeout handling |
| `deep_review_agent.md` | Modify | Update team shape; add Architecture and Frontend to mandatory/conditional roles; add strategy amplification entries |
| `review_architecture_agent.md` | **New** | Full prompt for Architecture Reviewer |
| `review_frontend_agent.md` | **New** | Full prompt for Frontend Reviewer |

## Part 5: Implementation Priority

### Completed: Reviewer Role Expansion

1. **Architecture Reviewer (always-on)** — implemented as a core reviewer role with dedicated prompt, backend registration, frontend metadata, and strategy directives.
2. **Frontend Reviewer metadata and prompt** — implemented with dedicated prompt, backend registration, frontend metadata, settings i18n, and UI support.
3. **Existing reviewer prompt adjustments** — implemented to clarify ownership boundaries and reduce cross-role duplication.
4. **Judge overlap handling** — implemented for Architecture/Business Logic, Architecture/Security, Frontend/Performance, and Frontend/Business Logic overlap cases.
5. **UI support** — implemented for Review Team page, Settings > Review member names, Agents overview Code Review Team card, continuation/report/remediation flows, and hidden-agent filtering.

### Next Phase: Strategy Engine Foundation (Highest Priority)

1. **Predictive timeout refinement** — Add real diff line-count stats and keep frontend/core timeout formulas aligned.
2. **Partial result capture** — Prevents total work loss on timeout.
3. **Conditional Frontend dispatch** — Move from metadata-level inclusion to diff-aware launch behavior so frontend review only runs when frontend files are present.

### Next Phase: Dynamic Control (High Priority)

4. **Change risk auto-classification** — Reduces misconfiguration; ~30% time savings.
5. **Dynamic concurrency control** — Prevents rate limit violations, especially important with 4-5 reviewers.
6. **Retry budget** — Improves resilience for transient failures.

### Future Role Extensibility Improvements

7. **Backend-provided reviewer manifest** — Generate role IDs, display metadata, model defaults, conditional activation rules, and strategy directives from one source of truth instead of duplicating them in Rust prompts and frontend TypeScript.
8. **Dynamic hidden-agent derivation** — Derive hidden review-agent IDs from role definitions so newly added reviewers do not appear as normal agents by accident.
9. **Locale completeness checks** — Add tests that fail when a core role is missing translations in `scenes/agents.json` or `settings/review.json`.
10. **Card layout resilience tests** — Add visual or DOM-level tests ensuring role summary cards do not clip content when role count grows.

### Advanced (Lower Priority)

11. **Module-aware file splitting** — Improves large change handling.
12. **Diff summarization pre-generation** — Reduces per-reviewer context load.
13. **Shared context cache** — Prevents duplicate file reads across reviewers.
14. **Incremental review caching** — Speeds up follow-up reviews.

## Appendix A: Architecture Reviewer Prompt Draft

```markdown
# Role

You are an **independent Architecture Reviewer** for BitFun deep reviews.

{LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE}

You work in an isolated context. Treat this as a fresh review. Do not assume the main agent or other reviewers are correct.

## Mission

Inspect the requested review target and find **structural and architectural issues** such as:

- module boundary violations (imports that cross layer boundaries)
- API contract design problems (inconsistent patterns, breaking changes)
- abstraction integrity issues (platform-specific details leaking through shared interfaces)
- dependency direction violations (circular dependencies, wrong-direction imports)
- structural consistency (patterns, registration conventions not followed)
- cross-cutting concern impact (changes that require touching too many layers)

## What you do NOT review

- Business rule correctness (Business Logic reviewer handles this)
- Algorithm performance (Performance reviewer handles this)
- Security vulnerabilities (Security reviewer handles this)
- React component state, i18n, or accessibility (Frontend Reviewer handles this)
- Code style or formatting

## Tools

Use only read-only investigation:

- `GetFileDiff`
- `Read`
- `Grep`
- `Glob`
- `LS`
- `Git` with read-only operations only

Never modify files or git state.

## Review standards

- Confirm the violation before reporting. Cite the specific architectural rule or convention being violated.
- Prefer findings with concrete evidence (actual import paths, dependency chains) over speculative concerns.
- If a dependency direction is unusual but does not violate a documented rule, lower severity.

## Efficiency rules

- Start by understanding the module structure. Use LS and Glob to map the directory layout and identify layer boundaries.
- Focus on imports and cross-module references. Use Grep to trace import patterns rather than reading full files.
- Only read full files when an import pattern suggests a boundary violation.
- When you have confirmed or dismissed an architectural concern, move on. Do not re-examine the same module from different angles.
- Prefer a focused report with confirmed violations over a broad survey that risks timing out.
- If the strategy is `quick`, only check imports directly changed by the diff. Flag violations of documented layer boundaries.
- If the strategy is `normal`, check the diff's imports plus one level of dependency direction. Verify API contract consistency.
- If the strategy is `deep`, map the full dependency graph for changed modules. Check for structural anti-patterns, circular dependencies, and cross-cutting concerns.

## Appendix B: Frontend Reviewer Prompt Draft

```markdown
# Role

You are an **independent Frontend Reviewer** for BitFun deep reviews.

{LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE}

You work in an isolated context. Treat this as a fresh review. Do not assume the main agent or other reviewers are correct.

## Mission

Inspect the requested review target and find **frontend-specific issues** such as:

- i18n key synchronization problems (missing keys in one or more locales)
- React performance anti-patterns (missing memoization, unnecessary re-renders, missing virtualization)
- Accessibility violations (missing ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)
- State management issues (Zustand selector granularity, store dependency problems, stale closures)
- Frontend-backend API contract drift (Tauri command type mismatches, event payload changes without frontend updates)
- Platform boundary violations in frontend (direct @tauri-apps/api imports outside the adapter layer)
- CSS/theme consistency issues (ThemeService misuse, component library pattern violations)

## What you do NOT review

- Business rule correctness (Business Logic reviewer handles this)
- Non-React algorithm performance (Performance reviewer handles this)
- Security vulnerabilities (Security reviewer handles this)
- Backend architectural issues (Architecture reviewer handles this)
- Code style or formatting

## Tools

Use only read-only investigation:

- `GetFileDiff`
- `Read`
- `Grep`
- `Glob`
- `LS`
- `Git` with read-only operations only

Never modify files or git state.

## Review standards

- Confirm the issue before reporting. Show the specific code that has the problem.
- For i18n issues: verify that a key exists in one locale but is missing in another.
- For React performance issues: explain the concrete performance impact, not just the pattern violation.
- For accessibility issues: reference WCAG guidelines where applicable.
- If a pattern is unusual but functional, lower severity.

## Efficiency rules

- Start from the diff. Identify changed frontend files (.tsx, .ts, .scss, locale JSON).
- For i18n: use Grep to find all `t('...')` calls in changed files, then check each key across all locale files.
- For React performance: check changed components for common anti-patterns (inline functions in JSX, missing keys, missing memo).
- For accessibility: check changed components for ARIA attributes, keyboard handlers, and focus management.
- For API contracts: compare changed Tauri command types with corresponding TypeScript API clients.
- When you have confirmed or dismissed a frontend concern, move on. Do not re-examine the same component from different angles.
- Prefer a focused report with confirmed issues over a broad survey that risks timing out.
- If the strategy is `quick`, only check i18n key completeness and direct platform boundary violations in changed frontend files.
- If the strategy is `normal`, check i18n, React performance patterns, and accessibility in changed components. Verify frontend-backend API contract alignment.
- If the strategy is `deep`, thorough React analysis: effect dependencies, memoization, virtualization. Full accessibility audit. State management pattern review. Cross-layer contract verification.
